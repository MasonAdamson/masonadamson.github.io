<!-- In all of the HTML files, if you compare to my old code it has changed 
 a good bit. Basically, now that I know at least a tiny about proper HTML, 
 my old code was giving me a heart attack. everything was just thrown
 all over the place. the links were personal file path links for some reason,
 The nav bar was only existent for the home page for some reason??? 
 anyway, I fixed all of that (i think).-->
